# Day 5: Learn Regular Expressions by Building a Password Generator
A Python module is a file that contains a set of statements and definitions that you can use in your code.

In this project, you'll learn how to import modules from the Python standard library. You'll also learn how to use Regular Expressions by building your own password generator program.

# What's new to me

# `random` built-in library
## `random.choice()`
The `choice()` function from the `random` module takes a sequence and returns a random item of the sequence.

# `secrets` built-in library
## `secrets.choice()`
Although the effect might seem equal to `random.choice()`, `secrets` ensure you the most secure source of randomness that your operating system can provide.

# `_`
A standalone single underscore is used to represent a value you don't care or that won't be used in your code. Your iteration variable is not actually used.

``` python
# instead of this
# for i in range(10):
#     x += 1
# We can use
for _ in range(10):
     x += 1
```

# Tuple
A tuple is another built-in data structure in Python. Tuples are very much like lists, but they are defined with parentheses `()`, instead of square brackets. Also, tuples are immutable, unlike lists.
```python
my_tuple = ('larch', 1, Ture)
```

# `re` built-in library
The `re` module allows you to use regular expressions in your code.

A regular expression, or regex, is a pattern used to match a specific combination of characters inside a string. It is a valid alternative to `if`/`else` conditional statements when you need to match or find patterns inside a string for validation purposes, character replacement, and others.
## `re.compile()`
The `compile()` function from the `re` module compiles the string passed as the argument into a regular expression object that can be used by other `re` methods.
```python
pattern = re.compile('i')
```

## `re.search()`
The `search()` function from the `re` module analyzes the string passed as the argument looking for the first place where the regex pattern matches the string.

```python
pattern = re.compile('i')
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(pattern.search(quote))
# // None
```
The value `None` is returned since `i` is not found inside the parsed string.
```python
pattern = re.compile('l')
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(pattern.search(quote))
# // <re.Match object; span=(5, 6), match='l'>
```
now the regex matches the first `l` inside the string.

In your pattern, you can add a quantifier after a character to specify how many times that character should be repeated. For example, the `+` quantifier means it should repeat one or more times.
```python
pattern = re.compile('l+')
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(pattern.search(quote))
# // <re.Match object; span=(5, 7), match='ll'>
```

You can also obtain the same result without using the `compile()` function:
```python
pattern = 'l+'
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(re.search(pattern, quote))
# // <re.Match object; span=(5, 7), match='ll'>
```

## `re.findall()`
`re.findall()` is similar to `search` but it returns a **list** with all the occurrences of the matched pattern.
```python
pattern = 'l+'
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(re.findall(pattern, quote))
# // ['ll', 'l']
```

# working with character
- A character class is indicated by square brackets and matches one character among those specified between the brackets. For example, `ma[dnt]` matches either `mad`, `man`, or `mat`.
```python
pattern = 'w[ha]'
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(re.findall(pattern, quote))
# // ['wh', 'wa']
```

- Character classes also allow you to indicate a range of characters to match. You need to specify the starting and the ending characters separated by an hyphen, `-`. Characters follow the Unicode order.
```python
# instead of '[abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]t' , we can just type
pattern = '[a-z]t'
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(re.findall(pattern, quote))

# // ['ot', 'st']
```
This matches any letter `t` **preceded** by a lowercase letter in the quote variable with the range of characters from `a` to `z`.

- The caret, `^`, placed at the beginning of the character class, matches all the characters except those specified in the class.
- The dot character, `.`, is a wildcard that matches any character in a string â€” except for a newline character by default.
``` python
pattern = '.+'
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(re.findall(pattern, quote))

# // ['Not all those who wander are lost.']
```
- If you need to match a character that has a special meaning in the pattern, such as `.` or `+`, you can escape it by prepending a backslash character, `\`. For example, this matches a literal plus sign: `\+`.

# Raw String
Python provides a particular type of string called _raw_ string. 
- Raw strings are prefixed with an `r`. 
- The key distinction from regular strings lies in how they handle the backslash character:
- in raw strings, backslashes are treated as literal characters rather than escape characters.
- When writing regular expressions, **using raw strings is a good practice**, since they can usually contain a lot of `\` characters.
``` python
pattern = r'\.'
quote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'
print(re.findall(pattern, quote))

# // ['.']
```

# More about character class
- In a character class, you can combine multiple ranges by writing one range after another inside the square brackets (without any additional characters)
- For example: `[a-d3-6]` is the combination of `[a-d]` and `[3-6]`.
- 
## Shorthand
- The character class `\d` is a shorthand for `[0-9]`.
- The character class `\D` is a shorthand for `[^0-9]` (not 0 to 9)
- `\w` is a shorthand for `a-zA-Z0-9` (Alphanumeric characters)
- `\W` is a shorthand for `^a-zA-Z0-9` (Non-alphanumeric characters)
```python
# Original
constraints = [ (nums, r'[0-9]') ]
# Shorthanded
constraints = [ (nums, r'\d') ]
```
- Since the underscore character is a valid character for variable names, it is included in the `\w` character class (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`), which can be conveniently used to match variable names.
- Therefore, the `\W` character class is equivalent to `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]` with the underscore character that is not matched. For this reason you cannot use it to match all your special characters.

# Combining raw string with an f-string
``` python
constraints = [
            (nums, r'\d'),
            (lowercase, r'[a-z]'),
            (uppercase, r'[A-Z]'),
            (special_chars, fr'[{symbols}]')
```
# Extra tips
Instead of using a loop and a counter variable, you can achieve the same result with a different approach.

``` original
While True:
  count = 0
  for constraint, pattern in constraints:
     if constraint <= len(re.findall(pattern, password)):
         count += 1
     
  if count == 4:
     break
```
