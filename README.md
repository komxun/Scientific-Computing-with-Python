The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters.

The goal of this puzzle is moving the disks from the first rod to the third rod, following specific rules that restrict placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

The Tower of Hanoi puzzle can be solved in 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks
