# Day 8: Learn Data Structures by Building the Merge Sort Algorithm
The Merge Sort Algorithm is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle.

In this project, you'll learn how to interact with data structures by sorting a list of random numbers using the Merge Sort Algorithm.

# What's new to me
The merge sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer principle to sort collections of data. That is, it 'divides' a collection into smaller sub-parts, and 'conquers' the sub-parts by sorting them independently, then merges the sorted sub-parts.

The merge sort algorithm mainly performs three actions:
1. Divide an unsorted sequence of items into sub-parts
2. Sort the items in the sub-parts
3. Merge the sorted sub-parts

The above happens recursively until the sub-parts are merged into the complete sorted sequence. Let's start by dividing the sequence.
