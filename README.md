# Day 10: Learn Tree Transversal by Building a Binary Search Tree
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is an common data structure where data is sorted hierarchically.

In this project, you'll learn how to construct your own BST and perform an in-order traversal. You'll also learn key operations like insertion, search, and deletion.

# What's new to me
A BST is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node, allowing for efficient searching and sorting operations.

This is what a Binary Search Tree looks like:
